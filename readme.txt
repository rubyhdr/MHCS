The folder 'MHCS' needs to be placed directly in the htdocs in xampp for it to work. This is because the directory has been clearly stated in the .htaccess files in the code.
Furthermore, the database needs to be added to localhost, and the localhost information needs to be updated in the 'config.php' file available in the file directory 
'MHCS/app/config/config.php'.
